# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modelling Case Study
We developed a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model** to estimate the intrinsic value of a business by projecting future cash flows and discounting them to present value. The analysis included calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and terminal value to ensure accurate valuation.  Edit content Design Analytics Settings Share

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the financial metrics of a company using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modeling. The case study evaluates key factors affecting asset composition, debt management, revenue growth, and financial health to draw actionable insights. The analysis is intended to guide investment decisions and assess the company's valuation and growth potential.

## Key Objectives
1. **Asset Composition Analysis**: Understanding the balance between current and long-term assets and their impact on liquidity and operational flexibility.
2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)**: Analyzing changes in the D/E ratio over four years and its implications for creditworthiness, financial risk, and capital access.
3. **Revenue Growth Analysis**: Evaluating total revenue growth trends and identifying key segments driving this growth (e.g., merchandise sales and membership fees).
4. **Gross Margin Assessment**: Comparing gross margins over three years to assess cost management relative to revenue growth.
5. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Analysis**: Highlighting how FCF analysis helps investors compare companies within the same industry for decision-making.

## Insights and Findings

### 1. Factors Affecting Asset Composition
- **Business Strategy**: Focus on liquidity and operational flexibility resulted in current assets comprising 51.7% in 2019, compared to 49.7% in 2018.
- **Growth Stage**: Fluctuations in long-term investments reflect changing priorities during growth cycles.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Highest liquidity ratio in 2020 (1.13) indicates a stronger emphasis on cash flow management.
- **Market Conditions**: Variations in cash holdings and short-term investments suggest responses to market trends.

### 2. Debt-to-Equity Ratio Analysis
- **2018-2021 Trends**:
  - Decrease in D/E ratio (2018: 2.12 → 2019: 1.91) reflects reduced reliance on debt.
  - Subsequent increase (2020: 1.97 → 2021: 2.28) suggests higher debt levels or declining equity.
- **Key Implications**:
  - Higher leverage raises financial risk and borrowing costs.
  - Creditworthiness concerns could lead to stricter loan terms or limited capital access.

### 3. Revenue Growth Trends
- **Overall Growth**: Total revenue grew by $43.2B (2019: $152.7B → 2021: $195.9B), a compound annual growth rate of ~13%.
- **Drivers**:
  - Merchandise Sales: Primary contributor with a 28.6% increase.
  - Membership Fees: Steady growth of 15.6%.

### 4. Gross Margin Stability
- Margins remained consistent (12.88%–13.08%) over three years, reflecting effective cost control relative to revenue growth.

### 5. Free Cash Flow (FCF) Utility for Investors
- **Cash Flow Sustainability**: Positive FCF signifies financial stability.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Companies with lower CapEx relative to revenue tend to maintain higher FCF.
- **Valuation**: Discounted FCF helps estimate enterprise value (EV) for comparing industry peers.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Financial metrics were compiled for analysis across four fiscal years (2018–2021).
2. **DCF Modelling**:
   - Projected free cash flows based on revenue, expenses, and investment trends.
   - Applied a discount rate to calculate present value of future cash flows.
3. **Visualization**:
   - D/E ratio trends and revenue growth were charted to illustrate changes over time.
   - Gross margin and liabilities vs. equity ratios provided additional context.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For financial modeling and data visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating dashboards and deriving actionable insights.
- **Python (optional)**: To automate repetitive tasks and analyze large datasets.
